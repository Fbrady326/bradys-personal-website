            <p>My name is Brady Foster, I am 21 years old and I recently enrolled in the Software Engineering Program at Flatiron School.
                <br> I decided to do the Software Engineering Program at Flatiron because I have always liked technology and I've wanted to
                <br> learn how to code for a long time. I was majoring in computer science at my college and I didn't like the way that they  
                <br> were teaching me, so I started looking for other options and I found Flatiron. I liked it because I can do the same
                <br> thing that I was doing in college, but I can get it done in a quicker time frame. I've been working on the prep work 
                <br> for the past month and I made this website because it is the final project in the prep work. My classes start in about
                <br> two weeks and I am excited to finally start becoming a programmer.
